## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

## How it works

On build, [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) navigates file dependencies starting at `main.js`. The files are bundled into `/dist/build.js`, which `index.html` references in a `<script>` tag.
